# CRS.DockerHostHelper
This module acts as an extension to the navcontainerhelper.  
Just to be able to add more functionality with dependencies to my own modules "Cloud.Ready.Software.*" that might be installed within 

This also means the module is higly dependent on the 'navcontainerhelper' module by Freddy Kristiansen.

## Rule of engagement
- All functions get its own file
- No files in the root folder
- Name should be like Powershell CmdLets: Verb-Noun
- All Nouns should start with "CRS"
