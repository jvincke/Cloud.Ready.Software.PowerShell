    .SYNOPSIS  
        Install/Upgrade Docker EE (Windows Server).

    .DESCRIPTION  
        This script checks the official Docker EE (for Windows Server) repository and
        detects the latest version available to download and install. It also compares
        with the version currently installed on the Docker host (WinServer) and asks
        you if you wish to proceed or not.
        You can use the script for the initial installation as well for upgrades that can
        be also canceled once you can see there is a version you don`t want to be installed.

        TO-DO:
            - Download docker-compose.exe file after the installation has been done 
              (this file is being removed with each installation).

    .NOTES  
        File Name  : 01_InstallDockerEE.ps1  
        Author     : Jakub Vanak (https://github.com/Koubek)

    .EXAMPLE
        Silent install:
